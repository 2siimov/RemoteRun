Senior High School student, Java noob learner

## How to Use
Download Client or Server jar file in the release page, put client jar on the computer to be compiling or running the code and put the server jar on the computer which will control the client machine to compile or run.
Make sure your computer has the runtime environment for the language you wanna compile or run
